<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>First a foremost I am a Tech enthusiast and I love to be a part of web development. I have done many bootcamps 
  over the years, I completed a 50+ hour long course back in 2019 and now I am doing the updated version of the 
  course for 2023. I want to be able to get a job in web development, I also have a passion and a degree in cyber
  security.
</p>

<p>Security is the foremost concern for all organizations both big and small. Hacking doesn't always mean damage, 
  invasion of privacy, or stealing confidential data. There exists an ethic to it. I have acquired knowledge in 
  using hacking to find loopholes in all types systems and to be able to strengthen them, Ethical Hacking is the 
  answer for any business that wants network security. The movement toward the cloud and Virtualization has led 
  to an increased level of threats and thus the demand for Ethical Hackers like myself.</p>
